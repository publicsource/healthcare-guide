      <p>Shopping for health insurance is a bit like buying a plane ticket. Just like you compare options to find the cheapest flight that still gets you to your destination smoothly, you want to find the health plan with the best coverage at the lowest price. The problem is there&rsquo;s no Orbitz or Expedia for health insurance.</p>

      <p>With the 2018 open enrollment period here, we compiled a guide below to help residents of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County choose the best health insurance plan.</p>
    </div>

            <h1>Here are five things you <u>need</u> to know about buying health insurance for 2018:</h1> 
            <ul>
              <li>The open enrollment period runs from Nov. 1, 2017 to Dec. 15, 2017.</li>
              <li>In Allegheny County, there are 34 different plans available on the HealthCare.gov marketplace, primarily offered by two providers: UPMC Health Plan and Highmark. </li>
              <li>The health insurance plans available to you and their prices change based on your age and income.</li>
              <li>Preexisting conditions are covered. You cannot be denied a plan in the marketplace based on a preexisting condition. </li>
              <li>Have an insurance plan through the marketplace? If you do nothing, you will be re-enrolled in the same plan. Due to several changes, you may want to shop around before re-enrolling because you could get better coverage for less.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Follow our guide below for more explanation of the options and available resources.</p>

      <h1>Understanding your health insurance options</h1>
      <img src="./img/car.gif" />
        <h2><span class="highlight">Can’t I just change my health insurance any time?</span></h2>
        <p>No. The open enrollment period, which ends Dec. 15, is the designated time frame to enroll in or change your health insurance coverage for 2018. Outside of this period, you can only change your insurance under a few special circumstances, such as a birth of a child or change in job status.</p>
        <h2><span class="highlight">Are there ways to get health insurance other than in the federal marketplace? </span></h2>
        <p>Yes. It is helpful to understand all of the options before you start shopping:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b class="mallory">Health insurance plans from the federal marketplace.</b> Find these plans at <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov" target="_blank">www.healthcare.gov</a>.</li>
                <li>You can buy <b class="mallory">direct from the health insurance providers</b>. In Allegheny County, that’s only UPMC Health Plan and Highmark. You can shop directly from UPMC Health Plan or Highmark, use a broker or shop one of the other online marketplaces such as ehealthinsurance.com.</li>
                <li><b class="mallory">Employer-provided plans</b>: Your employer may choose a plan and make a contribution toward the premium.</li>
                <li><b class="mallory">No insurance</b>: The Affordable Care Act stipulates that everyone must have qualifying health coverage or pay a fee. If you’re uninsured, you will be responsible for the Individual Shared Responsibility Payment. You will have to pay 2.5 percent of your income or $695 per person, whichever is higher. The maximum fee is $2,085 per person.
                <li><b class="mallory"><a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/medicaid/"  target="_blank">Medicaid</a></b>: Free or low-cost health insurance coverage for low-income residents.</li>
                <li><b class="mallory"><a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/medicare/"  target="_blank">Medicare</a></b>: Federal health insurance for adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities. You can switch from your marketplace plan to Medicare. More information is available <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/medicare/changing-from-marketplace-to-medicare/"  target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                <li><b class="mallory">Health care sharing ministry</b>: The Affordable Care Act states that individuals who are members of a health care sharing ministry are exempt from the individual healthcare mandate. <a href="http://www.medicalcostshare.com/comparison-of-major-healthcare-sharing-ministries.html"  target="_blank">Health care sharing ministries</a> are not insurance plans; they are a group of members who share the costs of the medical expenses. Unlike the marketplace, individuals can be excluded for a preexisting condition. To participate, you have to be a Christian and agree to live a Christian lifestyle, which includes no smoking, no illegal drugs, no abuse of alcohol and regular participation in worship.</li>
              </ul>

      <h1>Things to know before you shop for health insurance...</h1>
        <img src="./img/age.gif" />
        <h2><span class="highlight">Your age determines your options.</span></h2>
        <p>People 65 and older are eligible for Medicare, while people younger than 30 are eligible for catastrophic coverage — the least expensive insurance plan and the least coverage. Catastrophic insurance plans cover three primary care visits per year; everything else is paid out of pocket until a deductible is met. Children can be covered in family plans or under a federal health insurance program (more on that here).</p>

        <hr class="style11" />

        <h1>Your income changes what assistance is available to you.</h1>
        <img src="./img/money.gif" />
        <h2><span class="highlight">You may be eligible for Medicaid or for savings in the marketplace.<br><br>Here’s how to find out:</span></h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Before you shop, you can use the Pennsylvania Health Law Project’s Quickscreen tool to see if you are eligible for Medicaid.</li>
              <li>If your income is between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, you are likely eligible for a discounted health insurance plan.

        <h1>You’ll want to know what health insurance plans are accepted by doctors and providers you like.</h1>
        <img src="./img/doctor.gif" />
        <p>It’s a good idea to make a list of your current doctors and be sure they’re in the network before you make your health insurance selection.</p>
        <p>A doctor's office may accept your insurance, but if your insurance plan considers them out of network, you will likely have to pay more.</p>

        <h1>What health insurance providers offer plans for Allegheny County residents? </h1>

        <p>The Allegheny Health Network, which was formed from the merger of West Penn Hospital and Allegheny General Hospital, is a subsidiary of Highmark. The UPMC Health Plan is a for-profit arm of UPMC, which is a nonprofit with more than 30 hospitals. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Most of the doctors and hospitals in Allegheny County are affiliated with either UPMC or the Allegheny Health Network. Both networks have facilities in the city and across the county. (The two systems have a tense history. Read more here.)</li>
          <li>In an emergency, go to the nearest hospital. Regardless of your insurance network, emergency room visits are covered.</li>

        <h1>What is different for the 2018 open enrollment period?</h1>
        <img src="./img/2018.gif" />
        <ul>
          <li>The 2018 enrollment period is six weeks shorter than the past two years.</li>
          <li>The Silver Level plans may be more expensive but can offer additional savings or costs. Experts are recommending that shoppers compare plans at all metal levels.</li>
          <li>There is less funding for navigators and nonprofits to help with health insurance signups. HealthCare.gov has launched a new Help On Demand service to automatically connect a consumer to an agent or broker.</li>
          <li>Brokers work on commission. This year, some health plans have stopped commission payments, thus brokers would have incentive to steer a shopper in the direction of plans with a commission.</li>

      <hr class="style11" />

      <h1>What do the plan levels mean? And everyone wants gold, right?</h1>
      <img src="./img/gold.gif" />
      <p>This is one of the more confusing parts of shopping for health insurance. The metal levels only indicate how much your insurance plan pays for services versus what the individual pays, not the quality of care.</p>
      <p>In theory, an individual with a bronze plan would pay more for services at the time of care than someone who has a gold plan. The HealthCare.gov website explains that bronze plans may be good for someone who wants a low monthly premium and only wants to pay more if they have an emergency. Platinum plans have the highest monthly premiums, but you will pay less when you need care.</p>

      <h1>It is important to shop all plan levels for 2018</h1>
      <p>Health insurance brokers and advocates are recommending that consumers evaluate all levels of plans. Due to a reduction in subsidies (financial assistance offered to some consumers), many people are finding they are able to get a bronze plan for less or even free. There are also several reports of gold plans being significantly cheaper than silver for 2018. According to a New York Times report, gold plans are cheaper or less than $25 more than a silver plan in Allegheny County and adjacent counties.</p>
      <p>If you are shopping the marketplace and considering a silver plan, you should check the price of the plan directly with the insurance provider as well. One broker has noted that the silver plans are often less expensive if purchased outside of the marketplace.</p>

      <hr class="style11" />

      <h1>Subsidies and savings</h1>
        <h2><span class="highlight">Estimate your subsidy</span></h2>
        <p>You can use the Health Insurance Marketplace Calculator on the Kaiser Family Foundation website to estimate how much of a subsidy you are eligible to receive on a plan purchased through HealthCare.gov.</p>

        <script type="text/javascript">
                document.write('<ifr' + 'ame id="nnc-widget" frameborder="0" src="https://www.kff.org/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-foundation-2016/static/subsidy-calculator-widget.html" width="100%" height="750"></ifr' + 'ame>');

                }, false);
        </script>

        <p>There are two types of savings:</p>
        <p><span class="mallory">Premium tax credits:</span> You pay less on the monthly premium and will need to reconcile this amount on your tax return. If your income goes up, your tax credit will change.</p>
        <p><span class="mallory">Cost sharing reductions:</span> If your income is between 100% and 250% of the federal poverty level, you can receive a reduction on costs of health insurance. However, this reduction only applies to Silver Plan levels purchased through the HealthCare.gov marketplace.</p>

            <li>Copayments and coinsurance: Payments you make each time you get a medical service after reaching your deductible</li>
            <li>Out-of-pocket maximum: The most you have to spend for covered services in a year. After you reach this amount, the insurance company pays 100% for covered services.</li>
            <li>Specialist costs: For example, if you see a physical therapist, chiropractor or a psychiatrist regularly, you will want to note the copay and coinsurance costs and factor those into your total healthcare costs for the year. </li>
            <li>Pregnancy and delivery costs: While the Affordable Care Act requires every plan to cover pregnancy and maternity care, these costs can differ from plan to plan. Be sure to look at the fine print.</li>

        <h2><span class="highlight">What is the difference between the deductible and the out-of-pocket maximum?</span></h2>
        <p>A health insurance <span class="mallory">deductible</span> is similar to your car insurance deductible, an amount you have to pay before the insurance will start paying. Of the 34 plans available from the marketplace in Allegheny County, the deductibles range from $0 to $7,350 for an individual plan.</p>
        <p>The <span class="mallory">out-of-pocket</span> maximum is the total amount of deductible, copay and coinsurance you will have to pay in one year. Once you have spent the total out-of-pocket maximum, your insurance will cover everything (except monthly premiums).</p>

      <h1>PPO. EPO. HMO. …HUH?</h1>
        <p>Despite the confusion they cause, these acronyms carry important meanings. Below, we explain what they mean about the medical providers you would have access to and how many plans of each are available in Allegheny County. Most of the plans in the county are PPOs and EPOs.</p>

         <tr><td><span style="font-family: Mallory; font-weight: 600;">Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs):</span> HMOs usually limit coverage to care from providers who work for or contract with the HMO. An HMO generally won't cover or has limited coverage for out-of-network care except in an emergency. If you use a doctor or facility that isn't in the HMO's network, you may have to pay the full cost of the services you get. HMO members usually have a primary care doctor and must get referrals to see specialists.</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr>
         <tr><td><span style="font-family: Mallory; font-weight: 600;">Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs):</span> PPOs give you the choice of getting care from in-network or out-of-network providers. You pay less if you use providers that belong to the plan's network. You'll pay more if you use doctors, providers and hospitals outside of the network, and you may have higher out-of-pocket costs for services. If you have a PPO plan, you can visit any doctor without getting a referral.</td><td>0</td><td>22

      <h1>Health insurance for kids</h1>
      <img src="./img/crayons.gif" />
        <p>The Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, is separate from the Affordable Care Act. Created in 1997, CHIP is a federal program that is administered by the states. CHIP can provide coverage to any child in Pennsylvania for free or a reduced cost. Five things you need to know:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can enroll any time of the year.</li>
            <li>Even if parents’ income is above the Medicaid limit, children can be covered by CHIP. The Pennsylvania CHIP income ranges and rates chart are available here. For example, if the income for a four-person household is less than $51,168, the children in that household can receive CHIP coverage for free.</li>
            <li>To enroll in CHIP in Pennsylvania, apply through the Healthcare.gov marketplace, the Pennsylvania COMPASS system, by phone or mail in a paper application. </li>
            <li>There are three CHIP plans in Allegheny County: UPMC for Kids, Highmark and United HealthCare Community Plan of Pennsylvania.</li>
            <li>If your child has a Highmark plan, he or she will still have access to the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. Though it is a UPMC facility, Children’s Hospital accepts all insurance in the region. Its website has an extensive FAQ on insurance coverage here.</li>
          </ul>
